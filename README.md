# Food Waste Managemnt System
We will be making a website which will be used by the NGOs to Raise a Request to the Restaurant who are willingly ready to Donate their Excessive/Leftover food. Also the Restaurant Managers can the Update their Status of the food at the end of the day so that the nearby NGOs can pickup the Food and Distribute to the Needy.
